Telegram ChatBot that helps manage Emails. Replaces desktop and mobile Email clients in 99% of cases.

**Open Bot:** https://postamt_robot.t.me/

## Features

- **Email Management:** Perform various actions on your emails, such as reading, replying, sending, attaching files, and more.

- **Power of Threads:** Your emails are filtered by email addresses in a single Telegram supergroup. Telegram Threads technology allows us to organize the user experience similarly to native email clients (like Gmail, Outlook, etc.).

- **Multi-Account Support:** Connect and manage multiple email accounts within a single interface.

- **Security:** The bot never requests two-factor authentication and does not have access to the danger zone of your email account. It does not delete emails or manage passwords and personal data. Connection is made via auto-generated IMAP/SMTP access keys.
