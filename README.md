## üëã Say hello to POSTAMT

- **Web3 url:** https://postamt_robot.t.me
- **Classic url:** https://t.me/postamt_robot
- **In Telegram:** @postamt_robot

## üöÄ Features

- **Email Management:** Perform various actions on your emails, such as reading, replying, sending, attaching files, and more.

- **Power of Threads:** Your emails are filtered by email addresses in a single Telegram supergroup. Telegram Threads technology allows us to organize the user experience similarly to native email clients (like Gmail, Outlook, etc.).

- **Multi-Account Support:** Connect and manage multiple email accounts within a single interface.

- **Security:** POSTAMT never requests two-factor authentication and does not have access to the danger zone of your Email account. It does not delete emails, manage passwords and personal data. Connection is made via auto-generated IMAP/SMTP access keys. Your emails are not saved or cached anywhere after having read (even on the Telegram servers)

## ‚ùû Why named POSTAMT?

This project is named in honor of the St. Petersburg Main Post Office [–ì–ª–∞–≤–ø–æ—á—Ç–∞–º—Ç / Glavpochtamt], a monument of Russian history and culture.

"Postamt" is a German word that translates to "post office" in English. It refers to a facility or building where postal services are provided. Post offices are responsible for handling mail and packages, selling postage stamps, offering various postal services, and providing a range of other services related to mail delivery and communication. Postamt plays a crucial role in the postal system, facilitating the sending and receiving of mail and packages within a region or country.

Our POSTAMT semantically resembles a post office.
