## ‚ùû Why named POSTAMT?
This project is named in honor of the St. Petersburg Main Post Office [–ì–ª–∞–≤–ø–æ—á—Ç–∞–º—Ç / Glavpochtamt], a monument of Russian history and culture.

"Postamt" is a German word that translates to "post office" in English. It refers to a facility or building where postal services are provided. Post offices are responsible for handling mail and packages, selling postage stamps, offering various postal services, and providing a range of other services related to mail delivery and communication. Postamt plays a crucial role in the postal system, facilitating the sending and receiving of mail and packages within a region or country.

Our postamt semantically resembles a post office.
